# Project instructions

Vis reads Markdown instructions from your project and home directory. Changes
apply on the next turn without a restart.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` | Rules for working in a project |
| `.vis/SYSTEM.md`, `.vis/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` | Replace or extend the system prompt |
| `.vis/prompts/*.md` | Reusable prompts invoked with `/name` |

## Project rules: AGENTS.md

Put instructions for your codebase in `AGENTS.md` at the project root: how to
run tests, coding conventions and files that must not change. Vis includes the
file in every turn.

Several files can apply at once, from broadest to narrowest:

1. `~/.vis/AGENTS.md` — your personal rules, in every project.
2. `AGENTS.md` in each parent directory of the project, so a monorepo root and a
   subproject both apply.
3. `AGENTS.md` in the project root.

Nearer files come later and override broader ones on conflict. `CLAUDE.md` is
read only where no `AGENTS.md` exists.

## System prompt files

To change the system prompt itself, add files under `.vis/` in the project or
under `~/.vis/`:

| File | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SYSTEM.md` | Replaces the built-in system prompt |
| `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` | Adds text after the system prompt |

A project file overrides a user file. Append files are applied user first,
project last.

The built-in prompt describes Vis's tools. Use `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` or
`AGENTS.md` to add instructions without removing those descriptions.

## Prompt templates: /name

A Markdown file in `.vis/prompts/` becomes a slash command named after the file.
Project templates override those in `~/.vis/prompts/`.

```markdown
---
description: Review the current branch against main
---

Review the current branch against main. Focus on: $ARGUMENTS

End with a verdict: approve or request changes.
```

Typing `/review error handling` sends the file as a message with `$ARGUMENTS`
replaced by `error handling`. If the template has no `$ARGUMENTS`, the text is
appended at the end.

Slash commands registered by extensions take precedence over templates.

## Skills: /skill:name

Every [skill](skills.md) is available as `/skill:<name> [task]`. Skills are
hidden from the initial `/` list but appear when you search by name.

## Shell shortcuts: ! and !&

A message starting with `!` runs a shell command directly, without sending
anything to the model:

```text
!git status        # run and wait for the output
!&npm run dev      # start in the background and return immediately
```

Use `!&` for servers, watchers and long test runs. The output is stored in the
transcript, so later turns can refer to it.

Shell shortcuts need the **Shell commands** toggle enabled in settings.
