  "Single source of truth for the TUI's keyboard shortcuts.

   Shortcuts are CTRL chords, identical on every platform (macOS / Windows /
   Linux). The old Alt/Option chords were removed: stock macOS terminals send
   Option+letter as a special character, never an Alt modifier, so those chords
   silently did nothing. Ctrl always reaches the app.

   Two tiers:
   - `palette-chord` (Ctrl+P) opens the searchable command palette, which can
     run EVERY app verb. It is the discoverable entry point.
   - `bindings` are the direct Ctrl chords for the FREQUENT verbs, chosen to
     avoid the crowded control codes (Ctrl+M=Enter, Ctrl+I=Tab, Ctrl+H=BS,
     Ctrl+S=flow-control, Ctrl+O=stty DISCARD) and the emacs editing keys kept
     for the input box (Ctrl+A/E/K/U/W/D). Everything not here lives in the
     palette only.

   Every surface — the input dispatcher, footer hints, the help overlay, the
   clickable header chips — reads `bindings` / `action-for` / `chord` /
   `label-for` here, so a shortcut is defined once and stays in sync."

;; Each entry: the engine `:action`, the lowercase chord `:key` (matched against
;; the typed char while Ctrl is down), and a terse `:label`. Order is the help
;; overlay / display order. These are the FREQUENT verbs; rarer ones
;; (resources, sessions, voice, attach file, help, close tab) are reachable
;; through the Ctrl+P palette, which lists them all.
;;
;; Letter choices avoid control-code collisions and the kept emacs editing keys:
;;   F search (find) · R reasoning · L length · T model · B providers (backend)
;;   G context dirs.  (Ctrl+P is the palette, handled separately.)
