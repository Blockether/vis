  "Single source of truth for the TUI's Alt/Option chord shortcuts.

   The whole F-key row was retired in favour of Alt chords (Option on macOS):
   one modifier, one mnemonic letter, reachable without leaving the home row.
   The same modifier is reported by Lanterna's `.isAltDown` on every platform
   — what differs is only how it READS to the user: macOS keyboards print it
   as `⌥` (Option), everywhere else as `Alt`. So detection is uniform and only
   the LABEL is conditional.

   Everything that needs to know about a shortcut — the input dispatcher, the
   footer hints, the F1 help overlay, the clickable header chips — reads from
   `bindings` / `action-for` / `chord` here, so a new shortcut is added in
   exactly one place and every surface stays in sync."
