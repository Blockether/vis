# Bridge — CDP-free in-page automation (`spel bridge`)

The bridge lets spel drive a **real browser tab without CDP**. It works where
classic Playwright/CDP automation is dead — locked-down corporate machines,
managed browsers, disabled DevTools Protocol — because it never touches the
debugging protocol at all.

## Why it exists

CDP is often disabled in corporate environments, so `--cdp` / `--auto-connect`
/ `--auto-launch` cannot attach. But **loopback traffic (`127.0.0.1`) never
leaves the machine**, so a page that embeds a small script can talk to a local
spel server the proxy/firewall never sees. That is the whole trick: you stop
fighting the network and move the conversation on-box.

The moving parts:

- **`spel.js`** — a pure, dependency-free browser engine (no bundler, no
  extension, no CDP) that installs `window.__spel` with a single
  `invoke(command)` entry point mapping the spel/Playwright verb surface onto
  real DOM operations. It ships **inside the native image** as a classpath
  resource.
- **The bridge server** — a JDK-native loopback HTTP server
  (`com.sun.net.httpserver`, no extra deps) that serves `spel.js` and a
  two-way transport: **SSE** for commands (server → browser) and **JSON POST**
  for results (browser → server).

SSE + POST is used rather than WebSocket because it is JDK-native and behaves
predictably on loopback. `spel.js` tries WebSocket first, then falls back to
the SSE path the bundled server implements.

## CLI

```
spel bridge                         Start the loopback bridge (SSE + POST) on 127.0.0.1:8787
spel bridge use [url]               Route regular `spel <verb>` commands through the bridge
                                    (bare = the local bridge; or a remote http://host:port/spel)
spel bridge off                     Stop routing — commands go back to the Playwright daemon
spel bridge status                  Show the saved target + whether a browser tab is connected
spel bridge --eject                 Print the embedded spel.js to stdout
spel bridge --eject -o spel.js      Write spel.js to a file
spel bridge --eject --bookmarklet   Print a `javascript:` bookmarklet — one-click engine loader for pages you can't edit
spel bridge --eject --console       Print the same loader without the prefix (paste into DevTools)
spel bridge --eject-sw -o spel-sw.js  Write the service worker (same-origin passive-subresource capture)
spel bridge --eject-extension -o dir  Write an unpacked MV3 browser extension (any site, survives restart)
```

Options: `--host` (default `127.0.0.1`), `-p/--port` (default `8787`),
`--path` (default `/spel`), `-o/--output <file>`, `--token <token>` (default:
auto-generated). `--bookmarklet` / `--console` accept an optional
`http://host:port/spel` URL to target a remote bridge, and pick up the running
bridge's token automatically. If the fixed port is busy the bridge falls back to
an ephemeral one and prints it.

## Three ways to load the engine into a page

### 1. Embed the engine (full power, load it FIRST)

```html
<script src="http://127.0.0.1:8787/spel.js"></script>
<script>window.__spel.connect({url:"http://127.0.0.1:8787/spel",token:"<token>"})</script>
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` for a ready-made harness page that does exactly
this. **Load `spel.js` as the first `<script>` in `<head>`** if you want full
network capture — see "Network capture" below.

### 2. Bookmarklet / console loader (when you don't control the HTML)

**What it is:** a browser bookmark whose address is `javascript:…` code instead of a URL — so *clicking it runs code on the page you're already viewing*.
**What it's for:** injecting the spel engine into a page you can't edit (a live site, someone else's app) with a single click — no file access, no extension, no DevTools required. One click and the page is spel-drivable.

`spel bridge --eject --bookmarklet` emits a draggable `javascript:` bookmarklet
(Edge favorites / Chrome bookmarks — same Chromium engine). Clicking it on any
page injects `<origin>/spel.js` and connects. Idempotent: a second click just
re-connects. `--console` emits the same loader without the `javascript:` prefix
for pasting into the DevTools Console or saving as a Sources Snippet (bypasses
bookmark restrictions).

Caveat: bookmarklets load **late** (you click manually), so they are good for
*steering* a page but miss early network traffic. And a page's
`Content-Security-Policy` or a managed-browser policy can still block
inline/bookmarklet execution — that is policy, not network, and cannot be
worked around from the script.

### 3. Browser extension (any site, survives restart, no LNA prompt)

`spel bridge --eject-extension -o <dir>` writes an **unpacked Manifest V3**
extension (default `spel-extension/`) — the permanent, any-site, restart-proof
loader. Load it once and it beats every limitation of the bookmarklet:

```bash
spel bridge &                                  # start the local bridge
spel bridge --eject-extension -o spel-extension # bake the route + token into an MV3 extension
spel bridge use                                # route spel commands through it
```

Then in the browser — **Chrome, Edge, or Brave** (same Chromium engine):

1. Open `edge://extensions` (Chrome: `chrome://extensions`).
2. Toggle **Developer mode** (top-right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and pick the `spel-extension/` folder.

A content script injects `engine.js` at `document_start` on **every page**
(`<all_urls>`, MAIN world) and auto-connects to the bridge route baked into the
extension. Why it beats the bookmarklet:

- **No Local Network Access prompt.** The manifest declares
  `host_permissions` for `http://127.0.0.1/*` + `http://localhost/*`, so the
  browser grants loopback itself — no per-origin LNA grant, no greyed-out
  setting (see the LNA section below, which the extension sidesteps entirely).
- **Works on any site** and **survives browser restarts** — the route + token
  live in `chrome.storage.local`, re-injected on every load, no manual re-click.
- **Loads early** (`document_start`), so it captures network from page start,
  unlike the late-loading bookmarklet.

To point it at a different bridge (or refresh a rotated token), click the
extension's toolbar icon and set **Bridge URL** + **Token** in the popup (saved
to `chrome.storage.local`), then reload the target tab. Re-eject with a fresh
`--token` to bake a new secret in. The extension reuses the same embedded
`engine.js` + `spel-sw.js` as `--eject`/`--eject-sw`; the rest is thin MV3 glue.

### Local Network Access (LNA) — the loopback permission gate

Modern Chromium (**Edge 143+ / Chrome 142+**) gates *any* request from a public
origin (e.g. `https://www.onet.pl`) to `127.0.0.1` behind a per-origin **user
permission** — the successor to the older Private Network Access. The tell-tale
error is:

```
blocked by CORS policy: Permission was denied for this request to access the
`loopback` address space.
```

This is **not** a server bug and no response header fixes it — LNA is a user
grant, not a CORS negotiation. What the bridge does about it:

- The ejected loader fetches `spel.js` with `fetch(url, {targetAddressSpace:
  'loopback'})` — the sanctioned call that actually *raises the grantable
  prompt* (a bare `<script src>` no-cors subresource to loopback is denied
  silently). `spel.js`'s result POST carries the same flag; once the origin is
  granted, EventSource/WebSocket to loopback are allowed for that origin too.
- The bridge still emits `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true` for
  pre-LNA browsers.

What the **user/operator** must do when they hit the error:

1. Open `edge://settings/content/localNetworkAccess` (Chrome:
   `chrome://settings/content/localNetworkAccess`) and set it to *"Sites can
   ask"* (not "Don't allow"), or add the target origin to the *Allowed* list.
2. Re-run the bookmarklet and click **Allow** on the prompt.

If the setting is greyed out or no prompt appears, the box is **managed** and
IT policy blocks LNA (`LocalNetworkAccessRestrictions` /
`InsecurePrivateNetworkRequestsAllowedForUrls`). That can only be allow-listed
by the admin — it is the one case this bridge genuinely cannot route around.

## Routing regular `spel` commands through the bridge

Once you run `spel bridge use`, every regular `spel <verb>` (`click`, `fill`,
`snapshot`, `get_text`, …) is sent to the connected in-page engine over the
loopback bridge **instead of** the Playwright daemon — no `bridge send`, no CDP.
The target ("where/how we talk") is saved in **`~/.spel/bridge.json`**
(`{"url":"http://127.0.0.1:8787/spel"}`). Turn it off with `spel bridge off`;
inspect it with `spel bridge status`. On the same box `spel bridge use` (bare)
also copies the running bridge's **token** from `~/.spel/bridge-runtime.json`, so
routed commands authenticate with zero extra flags; for a remote bridge pass
`spel bridge use http://host:port/spel --token <token>`.

```bash
spel bridge &                       # start the server
spel bridge use                     # save the local bridge as the route
# ... open a page that embeds spel.js and connects ...
spel snapshot -i                    # runs in the real tab, via the bridge
spel click @e12
spel fill @e7 "hello"
spel bridge off                     # back to the daemon
```

Output shape is identical whether a command hit the daemon or the bridge (the
bridge adapts the engine's `{ok,value,error}` into the daemon's
`{:success :data :error}`).

## Security — token-gated loopback

Loopback is on-box, but **any page open in the same browser can `fetch`
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`**. To stop a rogue page driving the tab or reading
captured traffic, the bridge auto-generates a **token** on start and only accepts
requests that carry it:

- **SSE** (`GET /spel`) — token as `?t=` (EventSource cannot set headers).
- **`/spel/command`** and **`/spel/result`** — `?t=` or an `X-Spel-Token` header.

A missing/wrong token gets a `403`. The token is embedded into the served
harness page and the ejected loader/bookmarklet, published to
`~/.spel/bridge-runtime.json` for same-box discovery, and passed by
`route-command!` when routing regular commands. `spel.js` public source
(`/spel.js`) carries no secret. Setting an empty token disables auth (not
recommended).

## Surviving navigation (re-inject)

`window.__spel` lives in the page, so a **full-page navigation** rebuilds the
window and drops the engine + its SSE connection. To survive that, `connect`
remembers its route (`{url, token}`) in **sessionStorage** (per-tab, per-origin).
When a fresh page re-loads `spel.js` — e.g. a site template that `<script
src>`-embeds it on every page — the engine reads that route on install and
**auto-reconnects** without a manual `connect`. `connect` also replaces any
prior connection, so a tab holds exactly one live SSE/WS. `disconnect` clears
the saved route.

Caveats: SPA (same-document) route changes keep the engine alive and need
nothing. A bookmarklet-injected engine still dies on navigation because the new
page does not re-load `spel.js` — only embedding it in the page's HTML gives
true re-inject across full navigations.

## What the engine can do (`window.__spel.invoke`)

All driven through the single `invoke(command)` entry point, returning a
uniform `{action, ok, value|error}` promise (never rejects). ~100 handlers:

- **Interaction** — `click`, `dblclick`, `hover`, `focus`, `fill`, `clear`,
  `type`, `press` (modifier parsing), `keyboard_type`, `keydown`, `keyup`,
  `check`, `uncheck`, `select`, `scrollintoview`, `scroll`, `drag`, `highlight`.
- **Read/props** — `get_text`, `get_value`, `input_value`, `get_attribute`,
  `get_property`, `text_content`, `inner_text`, `inner_html`, `tag_name`,
  `get_count`, `count`.
- **State checks** — `is_visible`, `is_enabled`, `is_checked`, `is_editable`,
  `is_hidden`, `is_disabled`, `is_focused`.
- **Geometry/overflow** — `bounding_box`, `get_box`, `get_styles`,
  `overflow_info`, `is_overflowing`, `is_clipped`, `scroll_position`,
  `viewport_size`.
- **ARIA** — `get_role`, `get_accessible_name`, `get_aria`, `aria_snapshot`,
  plus the interactive `snapshot` (`@eXXX` refs via `data-pw-ref`).
- **Navigation** — `url`, `title`, `content`, `reload`, `back`, `forward`,
  `goto`/`navigate` (any URL, survives via sessionStorage re-inject).
- **Waits** — `wait_for` (state `visible|hidden|attached|detached`, timeout),
  `wait_for_timeout`, `wait_for_function` (predicate script), `wait_for_url`,
  `wait_for_load_state`, `wait_for_response`, `wait_for_request` (poll the
  in-page network record).
- **Refs** — `resolve_ref`, `clear_refs`, `find`.
- **Storage** — `storage_get`, `storage_set`, `storage_clear`.
- **Network capture** — `network_list`, `network_requests`, `network_get`,
  `network_get_ref`, `network_clear`, `network_capture`.
- **Overlay picker** — `pick`, `pick_stop`, `pick_toggle`, `picked`.
- **Server/transport** — `configure`, `set_server`, `get_server`,
  `choose_server`, `connect`, `disconnect`, `is_connected`, `ping`, `ready`.
- **Dialogs** — `dialog_handler` (policy `accept|dismiss`, `promptText`),
  `dialogs`, `dialogs_clear`: `window.alert/confirm/prompt/beforeunload` are
  wrapped, auto-answered per policy and recorded.
- **Console/errors** — `console_capture`, `console_list` (filter by level),
  `console_clear`: wraps `console.*` + `window.onerror` +
  `unhandledrejection`.
- **Cookies** — `cookies` (all or by name), `set_cookie`/`add_cookie`,
  `clear_cookies` (via `document.cookie`; HttpOnly cookies are invisible).
- **Request mocking** — `route` (match URL/method → `abort`, or fulfil with
  `status`/`body`/`headers`/`contentType`), `unroute`, `routes`. Same-origin
  `fetch`/XHR only, short-circuited in the wrapper before the network call.
- **Input/events** — `upload`/`set_input_files`
  (`files:[{name,content,mimeType,base64}]` → `DataTransfer`), `tap` (pointer/
  touch), `dispatch_event` (any `type` + `init`).
- **Frames** — `frames` lists same-origin iframes; any selector may be
  prefixed `frame=<iframe-sel> >> <inner-sel>` to act inside it.
- **Env emulation** — `emulate` (JS-level `geolocation`, `timezone`,
  `locale`/`languages`, `userAgent`/device metrics,
  `prefers-color-scheme`/`reduced-motion`).
- **HAR export** — `network_har` (the in-page capture → HAR 1.2 JSON).
- **Screenshot** — `screenshot` (DOM → SVG `<foreignObject>` → PNG data URL,
  SVG fallback on canvas taint).
- **Escape hatch** — `evaluate` (arbitrary in-page JS).

### Selector convention

`@eXXX` (regex `@e[a-z0-9]+`) resolves a snapshot ref
(`[data-pw-ref='eXXX']`); `text=…`, `css=…`, `xpath=…` / `//…` pick the matching
engine; anything else is a CSS selector.

**Locator composition** (Playwright's `>>`): chain segments with `>>`. A base
segment matches within the previous match set (`.card >> button`), and these
filter segments narrow it: `nth=N` (negative counts from the end), `first`,
`last`, `has-text="…"`, `visible[=true|false]`. `frame=<iframe-sel>` drills into
a same-origin iframe. E.g. `#list li >> has-text=Total >> nth=0`,
`frame=#app >> button >> visible`.

## Network capture (no CDP)

Without CDP you cannot attach to the debugging protocol, but pure in-page JS
captures traffic three ways: `window.fetch` (wrapped — method, URL, status,
request/response headers, request + response body via `clone().text()`,
timing, size), `XMLHttpRequest` (wrapped the same), and `PerformanceObserver`
(passive resources — img/script/css/beacon — URL, `transferSize`, timings; no
body/headers).

**Consequence: load `spel.js` first.** Capture works by *wrapping* `fetch`/XHR
at execution time — anything that fired before the script ran used the
original, unwrapped functions and is invisible. So: synchronous first
`<script>` in `<head>` for full capture; a late bookmarklet only sees traffic
from click-time onward.

### Service worker — passive subresources with real status/headers

`fetch`/XHR wrapping and `PerformanceObserver` leave one gap: passive
subresources the browser loader pulls on its own (`<img>`, `<script>`,
`<link rel=stylesheet>`, fonts, media) never touch the wrappers, and
`PerformanceObserver` sees only their timing/size — no status, headers or body.
A **service worker** (`spel-sw.js`) sits in front of the network for its whole
scope, so it *does* see them. Registered via `sw_register`, it intercepts those
passive requests, does the real fetch, and forwards a full network entry
(status, headers, body) back to the page tagged `via:"sw"`; the engine merges
them into the same `network_list`/`network_har` store (and steps the
`PerformanceObserver` path aside to avoid double counting).

A service worker is **same-origin only** and needs a secure context (https or
localhost). The bridge serves it at `/spel-sw.js`; for a page you control,
`spel bridge --eject-sw` unpacks it so you can drop it next to your HTML on its
own origin. Handlers: `sw_register` (`{:url … :scope …}`, defaults
`/spel-sw.js`), `sw_status`, `sw_unregister`.

## Overlay element picker (keymap)

The engine installs a global keydown listener:

- **Ctrl+Shift+L** — toggle the overlay picker: hover highlights elements, a
  click resolves the target to a ref/selector (retrieve with the `picked`
  handler). `Escape` stops it.
- **Ctrl+Shift+K** — open the branded connect modal (spel-themed, not a native
  `prompt()`) to choose/enter a server URL, then (re)connect. `Enter` connects,
  `Escape` (or clicking the backdrop) cancels.

Both hotkeys are configurable via the `configure` handler
(`{:hotkey … :serverHotkey … :server …}`).

## Distribution & native image

`spel.js` lives at `resources/com/blockether/spel/browser/spel.js` (classpath),
so it ships **inside the native binary** — the resource pattern
`com/blockether/spel/browser/.*` is listed in `resource-config.json`.
`spel bridge --eject` unpacks it from the running binary for standalone hosting.
The service worker `spel-sw.js` sits in the same dir (covered by the same
`com/blockether/spel/browser/.*` pattern) and unpacks with
`spel bridge --eject-sw`. `spel bridge --eject-extension` bundles both plus thin
MV3 glue (manifest, content/bootstrap scripts, popup, icons) into an unpacked
browser extension you load into Chrome/Edge.

## Limitations — document these upfront

Pure in-page JS cannot replicate everything Playwright's driver does. These do
**not** work through the bridge (by design, no CDP):

- **Protocol-level / cross-origin network interception** — `route` mocks
  **same-origin `fetch`/XHR** in-page (abort or fulfil); it cannot *mock*
  passive subresources (img/script/css) or cross-origin requests, nor rewrite
  at the protocol layer. (Passive **same-origin** subresources can now be
  *captured* — real status/headers/body — via the `spel-sw.js` service worker;
  that is observation, not mocking.) Use `references/NETWORK_ROUTING.md`
  (daemon/CDP path) for real cross-origin / protocol interception.
- **Cross-origin iframe reach** — same-origin frames only; the browser's
  same-origin policy blocks the rest.
- **New tabs / popups / downloads / file chooser at the OS level** — no driver
  to own the new target; `click --new-tab` and native file dialogs are out.
- **Real trusted input at the OS level** — events are synthetic
  (`dispatchEvent` + native value setters); most apps accept them, but a site
  checking `event.isTrusted` will not.
- **Page capture** — `screenshot` rasterizes the DOM via an SVG
  `<foreignObject>` → canvas → PNG (pure JS, no CDP; cross-origin images taint
  the canvas so it falls back to an SVG data URL, and it captures inline +
  same-origin styles, not a true device rasterization). **PDF export, video and
  trace recording** still need the renderer/CDP.
- **Environment emulation** — `emulate` overrides `geolocation`, `timezone`,
  `locale`/`languages`, `userAgent`/device metrics and
  `prefers-color-scheme`/`reduced-motion` at the **JS layer** (what page scripts
  read), like the `matchMedia` override — it does NOT affect the real network
  stack, CSS `@media` evaluation, permission grants or a real viewport resize.
  Those last ones need CDP.
- **HAR / init-script** — `network_har` exports the in-page capture as HAR 1.2
  (record); there is no HAR **replay**, and no true `addInitScript` before the
  page's own scripts (the engine loads at runtime; the closest thing is
  embedding `spel.js` as the first `<script>`).
- **Traffic before the engine loads** — see "Network capture" (load first).
- **Pages that forbid injection** — a strict `Content-Security-Policy` or a
  managed-browser policy can block the `<script>`/bookmarklet outright.
- **Multi-tab targeting** — a routed command is broadcast to every subscribed
  tab and the *first* result wins; there is no per-tab addressing yet. Keep one
  tab connected per bridge for deterministic routing.
- **Server-pushed events** — the transport is pull-only; there is no push
  channel from the tab. `console`, `dialog`, JS errors and network are
  captured **in-page** (once `console_capture`/`dialog_handler` are armed) and
  read by **polling** (`console_list`, `dialogs`, `network_list`,
  `wait_for_*`), not delivered as live events.

When any of these matter, prefer the daemon + CDP path (`--cdp`,
`--auto-connect`, `--auto-launch`) documented in `references/PROFILES_CDP.md`.
