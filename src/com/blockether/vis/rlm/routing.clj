  "Creates a sub-rlm-query function that routes across providers via a router.

   Output contract: {:content <str> :code <vec<str>|nil> :skills-loaded <vec|nil> ...}
     - :content is the prose answer (always present, SUB_RLM_QUERY_SPEC enforced).
     - :code is a vec of Clojure expressions when the sub-LLM emits them, else nil.
     - :skills-loaded echoes which skills were injected (nil when no skills).

   Internals: always calls llm/ask! with SUB_RLM_QUERY_SPEC. Provider-enforced
   JSON output guarantees the shape.

   When opts contains :skills [...], the corresponding skill bodies are
   prepended as system messages. Max 2 skills per call. Unknown skill → error.

   `routing` — default routing opts, e.g. {} or {:optimize :cost}.
   `skill-registry-atom` — atom holding {skill-keyword → skill-def} or nil.
   `rlm-env-atom` — atom holding the parent rlm-env (needed for iterated path).
                     Set after env construction via reset!. Nil → iterated path unavailable.
