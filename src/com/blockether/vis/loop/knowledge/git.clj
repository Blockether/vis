  "Git ingestion via JGit (pure JVM, no shell-out).

   Two-layer design:
   * Pure parsers (parse-commit-message, extract-ticket-refs, prefix->category,
     parse-git-log-entry, commit->entity, author->person-entity,
     file->file-entity) — no IO, unit-tested.
   * JGit IO (open-repo, git-available?, read-commits, head-info, blame,
     commit-diff, file-history, commit-parents) — wraps
     org.eclipse.jgit.* with structured return values.

   Consumers: rlm/ingest-git! stores commits as entities; the SCI sandbox
   binds search-commits / commit-history / file-history / blame / commit-diff
