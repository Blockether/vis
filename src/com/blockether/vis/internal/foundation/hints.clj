  "Foundation-shipped :turn.iteration/start hook tasks (D12).

   What used to be `:session/hints` is now hook-sourced tasks under
   `:session/tasks`. Two hooks remain:
     - `title-hint`            — set/refresh the session title via
                                  `(set-session-title! \"...\")`
     - `context-pressure-hint` — warn when prompt size crosses ~50%
                                  of window

   Each hook returns a TASK-SHAPE map (the loop wraps it as a full
   `::cs/task` keyed by the hook id):

     {:title        \"<imperative title>\"
      :importance   :info | :warn | :critical}

   The model satisfies a hook task by `(task-set! id {:status :done})`.
   The engine no longer verifies the claim — it just stamps `:done-born`
   and lets the done status stick. Honesty about whether the underlying
   action actually happened is on the model."

(def ^:const TITLE_REFRESH_TURN_PERIOD
  "Turn cadence at which `title-hint` fires. BOTH branches —
   blank-title (`:critical`) and refresh-tick (`:info`) — are now
   gated by this cadence; the hint surfaces on iteration 0 of
   turn 1 (first turn of the session), then on iteration 0 of
   every Nth turn after that (10, 20, 30, ...).

   Why blank-title is also cadence-gated now:
   the earlier rule fired `:critical` every iteration whenever the
   title was blank, so the hint re-fired every iter and
   `progress.clj` emitted one `Title — …` recap
   row per `(set-session-title! …)` call. Cadence-gating keeps
   the recap to at most one nudge per cadence tick — quiet inside
   any single turn, quiet on turns 2–9, etc.

   Why turn-cadence instead of iteration-cadence:
   the previous iteration-mod-12 rule never fired across a string of
   short single-iteration turns (session 9a55ca1a reproduced
   this). A turn-cadence rule fires once per visible focus shift
   and stays quiet inside any single turn no matter how long it
   runs."

   sweet spot of 95k-100k input tokens, before accuracy/latency
   degrade. Plenty of headroom remains for the current iteration's
   thinking + tool calls + answer payload."

   `(set-session-title! \"...\")`; there is no in-sandbox read
   binding for the current title (retired as redundant) — this hint
   carries the current value in its text body when refresh-cadence
   fires.

   Inputs are pulled from the host-supplied hint ctx:

     `:session-title` - current trimmed title (nil/blank if unset)
     `:title-refresh?`     - host signalled a turn-boundary refresh check
                             (true on iteration 0 of every turn)
     `:turn-position`      - 1-based turn position inside the session
     `:iteration`          - 1-based iteration position inside the turn
                             (retained for callers that probe the fn,
                              no longer used for cadence)

   Two branches, both cadence-gated:
     blank-title  : `:critical` — fires when title is blank AND the
                    host flagged `:title-refresh?` AND `turn-position`
                    is the first turn or a multiple of
                    `TITLE_REFRESH_TURN_PERIOD`. Quiet on intermediate
                    iterations and intermediate turns.
     refresh-tick : `:info` — fires when title is set AND the host
                    flagged `:title-refresh?` AND the same cadence
                    predicate holds. Otherwise nil."

   Inputs from the host-supplied ctx:

     `:input-tokens`             - `prompt_tokens` of the LAST iteration
                                   (proxy for the NEXT request's size).

                                   `context-limit`).
     `:cumulative-reasoning-tokens` - reasoning tokens this turn so far.
                                   Surfaced for the model's awareness
                                   on `:reasoning-style :server-managed`
                                   providers where the user otherwise has
                                   no visibility into hidden think budget.
     `:iter-count`               - completed-iteration count this turn,
                                   used to phrase the message and to
                                   suppress the hint on the very first
                                   call.
     `:context-limit`            - effective per-call input window for
                                   the resolved model (`:input-limit`
                                   from models.dev when present).

   Why `:input-tokens` is now last-iter and not cumulative:
     The earlier policy compared cumulative `:input-tokens` against
     `context-limit`, conflating two semantically different sizes
     (turn-spend vs per-call cap). Session 3102ad16 (2026-05-20)
     triggered the hint on iteration 13 at ~115K cumulative even
     though each provider request still fit inside ~10K tokens; the
     model started defensively flipping the hook-task
     `:vis.foundation/context-pressure` to :done (pre-D12 the same
     pattern surfaced as defensive `(satisfy-hint! …)` calls) and
     looping. Comparing the SAME-SHAPED number (per-call request size
     vs per-call cap) keeps the hint honest.

   Returns nil when either input is missing or non-positive - the
   hint is purely advisory and must never fail the iteration."
