(ns com.blockether.vis.loop.knowledge.git-wiring-test
  "Integration tests for W2 — git.clj wired into the RLM runtime.
   Covers (1) single-repo wiring, (2) multi-repo auto-dispatch via path for
   blame/file-history and via SHA for commit-diff, (3) system prompt renders
   one GIT REPO block per attached repo, (4) DB-backed repo attachments
   (no atoms — :repo entities persist in SQLite, git SCI tools open+close
   Repositories lazily per call).

   All git tools are prefixed `git-`.

   NOTE on temp repo creation: we use shell `git` (not JGit's Git.init) so
   we can pass `-c gpg.format=openpgp -c commit.gpgsign=false`, bypassing
   any user-level `gpg.format=ssh` setting that JGit 6.10 can't parse.
   Production code (rlm-git/open-repo + read-commits) only reads repo
   state and never touches gpg config, so it works fine on the resulting
   .git/ directory."
