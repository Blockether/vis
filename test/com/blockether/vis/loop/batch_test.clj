  "Unit tests for sub-rlm-query-batch — parallel fan-out primitive.

   Tests cover:
   - Order preservation when workers finish out of order
   - Error isolation: one item's failure doesn't affect others
   - Empty input returns empty vec without calling fn
   - Single item works correctly
   - Dynamic binding propagation into child futures
   - Semaphore bounding: concurrency cap respected
   - Batch never throws (including non-Exception Throwable)"
